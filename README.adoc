= Example Test Project for SLF4J and Logback

This Java, Maven-based project tests and asserts the configuration as well as the logging behavior
of SLF4J `2.0.x` with Logback `1.4.x` vs. SLF4J `1.7.x` with Logback `1.2.x`.

Specifically, this test project asserts the configuration of Logback and functionality of SLF4J logging
when using the `<include>` configuration directive to compose Logback XML-based configuration files.

This project and its tests can be run with SLF4J `1.7.x` (`1.7.36`) and Logback `1.2.x` (`1.2.11`) using:

.Maven build
----
$ mvn clean package
----

Or, or run with SLF4J `2.0.x` (`2.0.2`) and Logback `1.4.x` (`1.4.1`) using:

.Maven build
----
$ mvn -P logback14x clean package
----
