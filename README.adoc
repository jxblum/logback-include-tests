= Example Test Project for SLF4J and Logback

This Maven-based Java project tests and asserts the configuration of SLF4J `2.0.x` vs. SLF4J `1.7.x`
and Logback `1.4.x` vs. Logback `1.2.x`.

Specifically, this test projects asserts the configuration and functionality when using
the `<include>` configuration directive to compose Logback XML-based configuration files.

You can run this project (tests) with SLF4J `1.7.x` (`1.7.36`) and Logback `1.2.x` (`1.2.11`) using:

.Maven build
----
$ mvn clean package
----

Or, using SLF4J `2.0.x` (`2.0.2`) and Logback `1.4.x` (`1.4.1`):

.Maven build
----
$ mvn -P logback14x clean package
